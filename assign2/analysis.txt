reverse(): The time complexity for the reverse function is O(n). 
           This is because the while loop runs once for each node in the list.
           Inside the while loop, the operations have a time complexity of O(1).

remove_if(): The time complexity for the remove_if function is O(n). 
             This is because the predicate functions and the erase 
             function have a time complexity of O(1).
