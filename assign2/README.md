Assignment 2: Doubly-Linked List Container -- STL Interface

Objectives: Understanding generic programming and information hiding by developing generic containers. Getting familiar with the concept of class template and its usage. Use of nested (iterator) classes. Use of namespace. Operator overloading.

Task: Implement a doubly-linked list class template List and its associated iterators, with the same interface and iterator usage as found in the C++ STL.
